I would like to join your group because I think this is a great idea. I really like that it keeps track of where you have been and at what times you wrote it at. I think location and time often get lot from my journal entries so I think its a cool idea and product that I would actually consider using. I have experience working with both front and back end for my jobs, and I have also worked as a big data analyst so I have some experience in databases and working with postgresql. So I could work wherever you would need me. 

I think its a good business idea to do both free and premium. Another cool thing you could throw in is maybe do something like chat books, where after a certain number of entries you get a hard copy book of your journal entries in the mail. Maybe that could be an idea for a potential premium version. 

For the legal side, Its a free app(for the most part) and journals have been around for ages so its not like people would be able to come after us for this idea.

On the technical side I think it should be fairly straight forward. We would simply need user tables, entry tables and maybe time and location tables. Making a front end should be fairly straight forward. I think that they main thing that would take up time would be making it into a nice product.
